This is a website in Portuguese that was created to help medical doctors (specially radiologists, like me) with recent guidelines, model reports and reference values we need in our day-to-day practice. 
In “Ferramentas” you will have access to evidence-based tools that guides the risk classification of imaging exams findings and how to follow-up.
In “Laudos” we offer standardized report lexicon to radiographies, ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance exams.
In “Aulas” you can see some classes about interesting themes of Radiology.
